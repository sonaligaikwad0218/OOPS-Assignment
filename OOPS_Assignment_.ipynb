        " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "     - OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around objects and classes . Objects represent real-world entities with properties (data) and methods (functions) .Classes are Blueprints for creating objects .\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "     - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects . Defines properties (data) and methods (functions) .Serves as a template for creating multiple objects with similar characteristics\n",

        "     - Abstraction Hides implementation details, showing only necessary information. Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.Helps reduce complexity by exposing only essential features .\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Encapsulation Bundles data and methods that operate on that data.Restricts access to certain details, controlling how data is accessed or modified .Protects data integrity by controlling access through methods.\n",
